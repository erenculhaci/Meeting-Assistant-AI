Not bad, just a bit busy with work lately. But I'm always happy to catch up with you. Me too. So, what's new with you? Well, I've been trying to get into gardening recently. Oh, that's cool. What have you been planting? I've started with some herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme. And I'm also growing a few tomatoes and peppers. That sounds delicious. I've always wanted to try gardening, but I'm not sure I have a green thumb. Don't worry, it's not that hard. And it's actually quite relaxing. Plus, it's a great way to get some fresh produce. Yeah, I might give it a try. What else have you been up to? I've also been taking some online courses in photography. I've always been interested in it, and I'm really enjoying learning about different techniques. That's great. I've seen some of your photos on Instagram, and they're amazing. Thanks. I'm still practicing, but I'm getting better all the time. I'm sure you are. What kind of photography do you like most? I like to take pictures of nature in landscapes, but I'm also interested in portrait photography. I love nature photography too. There's something so calming about being in nature and capturing its beauty on camera. I agree. And I find that portrait photography is a great way to capture people's personalities and emotions. That's true. So, what are your plans for the weekend? I'm planning to go hiking with some friends on Saturday. And then on Sunday, I'm going to visit my family. Sounds like a fun weekend. I'm going to a concert on Saturday night with my boyfriend. And then on Sunday, I'm just going to relax at home and catch up on some reading. Nice! I'm sure you'll have a great time. Thanks. I'll see you soon, Alex. See you later, Emily."
