00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,100
[Speaker_01]  How about you?

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,379
[Speaker_02]  Not bad, just a bit busy with work lately.

00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:31,600
[Speaker_02]  But I'm always happy to catch up with you.

[Speaker_00]  Me too.

00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,759
[Speaker_00]  So, what's new with you?

10
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,079
[Speaker_01]  Well, I've been trying to get into gardening recently.

11
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,719
[Speaker_02]  Oh, that's cool.

12
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,460
[Speaker_02]  What have you been planting?

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:00,000
[Speaker_02]  I've started with some herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme.

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,560
[Speaker_02]  And I'm also growing a few tomatoes and peppers.

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,060
[Speaker_00]  That sounds delicious.

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,780
[Speaker_00]  I've always wanted to try gardening, but I'm not sure I have a green thumb.

17
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,140
[Speaker_01]  Don't worry, it's not that hard.

18
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,799
[Speaker_01]  And it's actually quite relaxing.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,819
[Speaker_02]  Plus, it's a great way to get some fresh produce.

20
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,760
[Speaker_00]  Yeah, I might give it a try.

21
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,700
[Speaker_00]  What else have you been up to?

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,620
[Speaker_01]  I've also been taking some online courses in photography.

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:52,200
[Speaker_01]  I've always been interested in it, and I'm really enjoying learning about different techniques.

24
00:01:52,459 --> 00:02:01,799
[Speaker_01]  That's great. I've seen some of your photos on Instagram, and they're amazing.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,960
[Speaker_02]  Thanks. I'm still practicing, but I'm getting better all the time.

26
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:30,087
[Speaker_00]  I sure you are What kind of photography do you like most I like to take pictures of nature in landscapes But I also interested in portrait photography

27
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,687
[Speaker_01]  I love nature photography, too.

28
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:43,047
[Speaker_01]  There's something so calming about being in nature and capturing its beauty on camera.

29
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:46,747
[Speaker_02]  I agree.

30
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:55,027
[Speaker_02]  And I find that portrait photography is a great way to capture people's personalities and emotions.

31
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,807
[Speaker_00]  That's true.

32
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,967
[Speaker_00]  So, what are your plans for the weekend?

33
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:09,787
[Speaker_01]  I'm planning to go hiking with some friends on Saturday.

34
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,927
[Speaker_01]  And then on Sunday, I'm going to visit my family.

35
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,667
[Speaker_02]  Sounds like a fun weekend.

36
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:25,067
[Speaker_02]  I'm going to a concert on Saturday night with my boyfriend.

37
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:32,447
[Speaker_02]  And then on Sunday, I'm just going to relax at home and catch up on some reading.

38
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:39,747
[Speaker_00]  Nice. I'm sure you'll have a great time.

39
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,927
[Speaker_01]  Thanks. I'll see you soon, Alex.

40
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:51,727
[Speaker_01]  See you later, Emily!

41
00:03:56,827 --> 00:04:01,867
[Speaker_02]  To get into means to become involved or interested in something.

42
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:08,867
[Speaker_02]  It's like starting to participate in or enjoy a particular activity or hobby.

43
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:19,787
[Speaker_02]  For example, if you decide to get into hiking, it means you start to explore hiking trails and spend time outdoors enjoying nature.

44
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:28,047
[Speaker_02]  Capturing means recording or taking a picture of something, often to preserve a moment or image.

45
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,947
[Speaker_02]  It's like freezing a moment in time.

46
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:56,355
[Speaker_02]  For example if you capturing a sunset with your camera you taking a photograph to remember the beauty of the scene A green thumb is an idiom used to describe someone who has a natural talent or ability for gardening and growing plants successfully It like being skilled at nurturing and caring

47
00:04:56,355 --> 00:05:04,075
[Speaker_02]  for plants, so they thrive under your care. For example, if someone has a green thumb,

48
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:08,095
[Speaker_02]  they can make even the most difficult plants grow beautifully.

49
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:12,235
[Speaker_02]  Let's listen carefully to the dialogue one more time.

50
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,815
