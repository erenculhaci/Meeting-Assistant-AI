1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Speaker_00]  Listen to the dialogue and practice your speaking, listening, and pronunciation skills.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[Speaker_01]  Hey Emily, how's it going?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
[Speaker_02]  Hey Alex, great to see you.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
[Speaker_02]  I'm doing well, thanks for asking.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
[Speaker_02]  How about you?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
[Speaker_01]  Not bad, just a bit busy with work lately.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
[Speaker_01]  But I'm always happy to catch up with you.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[Speaker_02]  Me too.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
[Speaker_02]  So, what's new with you?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
[Speaker_01]  Well, I've been trying to get into gardening recently.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
[Speaker_02]  Oh, that's cool. What have you been planting?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
[Speaker_01]  I've started with some herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
[Speaker_01]  And I'm also growing a few tomatoes and peppers.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
[Speaker_02]  That sounds delicious.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
[Speaker_02]  I've always wanted to try gardening, but I'm not sure I have a green thumb.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
[Speaker_01]  Don't worry, it's not that hard.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
[Speaker_01]  And it's actually quite relaxing.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
[Speaker_01]  Plus, it's a great way to get some fresh produce.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
[Speaker_02]  Yeah, I might give it a try.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
[Speaker_02]  What else have you been up to?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
[Speaker_01]  I've also been taking some online courses in photography.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
[Speaker_01]  I've always been interested in it, and I'm really enjoying learning about different techniques.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
[Speaker_02]  That's great.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
[Speaker_02]  I've seen some of your photos on Instagram, and they're amazing.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
[Speaker_01]  Thanks.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
[Speaker_01]  I'm still practicing, but I'm getting better all the time.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
[Speaker_02]  I'm sure you are.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
[Speaker_02]  What kind of photography do you like most?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
[Speaker_01]  I like to take pictures of nature in landscapes.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
[Speaker_01]  But I'm also interested in portrait photography.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
[Speaker_02]  I love nature photography too.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
[Speaker_02]  There's something so calming about being in nature and capturing its beauty on camera.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
[Speaker_01]  I agree.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
[Speaker_01]  And I find that portrait photography is a great way to capture people's personalities and emotions.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
[Speaker_02]  That's true.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
[Speaker_02]  So, what are your plans for the weekend?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
[Speaker_01]  I'm planning to go hiking with some friends on Saturday.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
[Speaker_01]  And then on Sunday, I'm going to visit my family.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
[Speaker_02]  Sounds like a fun weekend.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
[Speaker_02]  I'm going to a concert on Saturday night with my boyfriend.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
[Speaker_02]  And then on Sunday, I'm just going to relax at home and catch up on some reading.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
[Speaker_01]  Nice! I'm sure you'll have a great time.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
[Speaker_02]  Thanks. I'll see you soon, Alex.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
[Speaker_01]  See you later, Emily.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
[Speaker_00]  To get into means to become involved or interested in something.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
[Speaker_00]  It's like starting to participate in or enjoy a particular activity or hobby.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
[Speaker_00]  For example, if you decide to get into hiking, it means you start to explore hiking trails and spend time outdoors enjoying nature.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
[Speaker_00]  Capturing means recording or taking a picture of something, often to preserve a moment or image.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
[Speaker_00]  It's like freezing a moment in time.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
[Speaker_00]  For example, if you're capturing a sunset with your camera, you're taking a photograph to remember the beauty of the scene.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
[Speaker_00]  A green thumb is an idiom used to describe someone who has a natural talent or ability for gardening and growing plants successfully.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
[Speaker_00]  It's like being skilled at nurturing and caring for plants, so they thrive under your care.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
[Speaker_00]  For example, if someone has a green thumb, they can make even the most difficult plants grow beautifully.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
[Speaker_00]  Let's listen carefully to the dialogue one more time.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
[Speaker_00]  Hey Emily, how's it going?

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
[Speaker_01]  Hey Alex, how's it going?

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
[Speaker_02]  Hey Alex, great to see you.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
[Speaker_02]  I'm doing well, thanks for asking.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000

[Speaker_01]  Not bad, just a bit busy with work lately.

[Speaker_01]  But I'm always happy to catch up with you.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
[Speaker_02]  Me too.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
[Speaker_02]  So, what's new with you?

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
[Speaker_02]  I've always wanted to try gardening, but I'm not sure I have a green thumb.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:37,000
[Speaker_01]  Don't worry, it's not that hard. And it's actually quite relaxing. Plus, it's a great way to get some fresh produce.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
[Speaker_02]  Yeah, I might give it a try. What else have you been up to?
