  "full_text": " I can record. And we don't have a ton of items to get to. And I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. So corporate events, I think I saw a little. I put this in Slack, and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. The nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and tried different things, the event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go to market team, signs up, and kind of sponsors that event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I don't see anyone in the, maybe there are comments in the issue. I don't see the header updated yet. I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them out. So I guess the next, so it looks like Ty put in some folks. It looks like this looks good. Let's see, need support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be to work with your GTM teams. Let me ask, I saw some Slack, I think in our Slack, but did you all, were you all able to connect with your GTM teams? On Slack only and on the issue actually. Yeah, same, not in real time, but source feedback. I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picking the one that we want to do, and then they can back us up if we don't get any more feedback. Yeah, do you all, does anybody have like a regular sync still? Are those all been canceled or is there? Yeah, we're on like the two week cadence. OK. Yeah, GitOps has been canceled after the enablement. Cool, so I'm just trying to catch up with the thread. So it looks like maybe a platform on reinvent, CICD on Google Next and GitOps on KubeCon, does that sound right? Yeah. Yep, that's where we were last I heard. Cool, so then I think we can, I think we can help the Corp Events team. They do a lot of like cat herding and keep on tracking people down. So I think if this team can take the mission to try to help track that down. So if you get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, we're signing up for KubeCon. Can you comment on the issue that, yes, I can commit to this, etc, etc, etc, you know, so that just so that they can get that that event support. But that looks good. And I appreciate thanks for the link to Samia on the roles. Product announcements. So I appreciate Brian for adding this. I probably should have added it, but. I had two questions about that one. One is over what time frame are we looking at? So so in theory, this is this could be the same as the GitLab 14 launch, where we're saying basically since 13.0, what has you know, what kind of big improvements have we made? Candidly, this is always a little bit tough, and I'm and I'm I am not totally sure of all of the. Kind of the interplay here, but I think I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is OK, we have commit coming up. We have some amount of like we have a stage, you know, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? I get lab, it's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire road map is completely public, yada, yada, yada. So the thought here is to. But also, because our entire road map is completely public and because we ship these tiny little NBCs, a new feature will come out, but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, OK, like what started in the last year, but now is really like a full fledged feature, what would what would be coming out of beta? Right. Like if we were any other company when we started a beta program in this last year, what would be be announcing as GA at commit? That's kind of that's kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of heads. What do you think, Cindy? Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say, like vulnerability management, because there were tiny little NBCs all the way along. But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this. It makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was. We just had 14.0. Can we just can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And vulnerability management was was one of the, you know, the features out of we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is like let's take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give give our PR team. This is kind of like input into our PR team to give them fodder to go out with. And are we trying to hit three per stage? Yeah, ideally, there's just, you know, three, you know, three items per stage. And then I think you all made some good notes that, OK, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here. That's excellent. And integrations, we don't. Well, actually, we have some pretty exciting integration. So we have the Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with VS code that could be notable, but. Can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it? And if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick. I was going Cindy's direction here, which was thinking, you know, a lot of. And then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall, so we would have like one thing to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with Gitaly cluster, several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket, except that actually, that's that's super typical, like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out. They almost always have UX as one of their three things. And then they mention a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I, you know, forgave myself for doing something. And at first, I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there. But actually, when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level, that also like I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken. And that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about. But actually, some of that stuff's really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things. But I figured I wouldn't like to Cindy's comment, have something that's a one here anyway. But the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as something. And so that's kind of how I came down on it. I don't know what everyone thinks about that. I like that. I've done a similar I've taken a similar approach for monitor with incident management. There were a bunch of things that we released, although the core of incident management was part of 12.x. I think so. I did the same there as well. I think that makes sense. Yeah, that would help me with the plan stuff as well, because there are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have. And that's great. But I think, you know, like the milestone burn up charts. That was a two and that's helpful. And I was looking through features and actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting. But we can bundle that with some other things and up level it. So that would be helpful there. And also, Brian, about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were community contributions, which is also kind of cool. Is that is do we have VS code listed on here? I didn't add it, but I can I can add that in. I've got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things, but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. And that I think that's a that's a pretty good note as well. We did that with like our Terraform module, right? There was like a community module, but now it's officially supported. So that's that's the you know, that can be the line. Yes or no, whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one, too. How are we measuring excitement levels? How are we measuring excitement levels? One, two and three is that. I was I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that, are interested in using that or not. We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it, wherever we have it, it's probably something we can we can use. But we of course, we need a benchmark level of what MAU we want to call one, two or three. I think it's a little it's a little bit of a judgment call, like, you know, for example, Cormac was saying like epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time now. Depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting or it's not right. But usually when something gets a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it, then I would I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly, it's something shipped and a lot of people are using it, the MAU. That's another good measure. I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual judgment column, just like what is what is your feeling based on, you know, could be anecdotal, like you talk to customers and they're like really hyper excited about this. Or, you know, maybe not, which is which is okay. I think it's okay. Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah, I might. I might even constrain us is we're not going to highlight low excitement, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we have slim pickings. Alternately, if there are double digit entries, then we can stack rank. So that's that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that I mean, it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So, I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out one, one, two or three. Rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily. Hard to somebody's one or somebody's three may be more important than somebody else's one. Agreeing on that. And I had, I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past two years. And, you know, there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning that could be on the list. Like, I could give you 10 things instead of three. Give it. Give this just like the rough like pass and Like a lot of things are really important. Yeah. So, Like I could give you 10 things instead of three. Yeah, give it. Give this just like the rough like pass and Like a lot of things recently I've been moving between docs and spreadsheet and the spreadsheet to docs. This, you know, this might this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank and PR is like, okay, out of all of like the You know, there's maybe 10 boxes here and three each out of the 30 items which are the top five. Actually, let's just let's actually just do that. Let's just do this like top top five overall we This one is a PR driven to some degree. What about like a new Ben Christie's product keynote at commit, are we that I'm telling this with that. So this is exactly where this is headed to Is the idea that during the product keynote and then ideally during kids since keynote as well that there's some level of like an announcement that we make that then the press cares about that announcement. Again, really tough to do at your lab because it's all been around for a while. So this is This is our attempt to head to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event. And yeah, maybe it's some things that have been around for a while. But like now they're at a level of maturity. Now, you know, there's, there's reason to be excited about this. So that's kind of where it's coming from. So I put A top five overall. Maybe we can just You know, You should reserve a spot for plan, but I'm going to have to go through and do some aggregating after this just go through the list of what ship the last 12 months and re bucket that So, Maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like Just just time box and kind of look at these here. What do you all think is top would be a top five out of the list of, you know, 20 or 30 I would say if UX does end up being a flag that we fly. That's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage that would be considered UX improvement. Okay. What else We need to have a security one in there. We could have either vulnerability management or I was what I've been struggling with a little bit is I'd like to kind of group. The Some of this proprietary scanning Without making it sound like they're scanning improvements because that sounds like they weren't good before. Yeah. Let's, let's go with vulnerability management for now. I would agree on that one. And I would say that I'm Some of these we did do some press around and the the fuzzing of the Some of these we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing. So we might not get Old I I was, I mean, we did the fuzzing acquisitions along time ago. Was it within the past year or longer. I thought it was within the past year. I think it was in the last little over six months or so. It was last summer, right. Or something around there. It was like last spring or summer. And then we did another set of press around the integration of it because the PR team liked all the I mean we got a lot of attention on the acquisition. So they had me do a follow up. On the integration. I just feel like it's kind of worn out now. Right. That's what I was saying is that the fuzzing. We already did press on through probably will not get another chomp at that. So I think let's go with vulnerability management. And review. But we also have in terms of proprietary stuff. We've also got we replaced one of our scanners with some grip and we did. We have our own proprietary DAS scanner now that's in It's in beta called browser. So it's our answer to scanning single page applications which represent a unique challenge. I think I mean, if I could have to, it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably Okay. Some breath that get picked up as a online item and a couple of the pieces about get that 14 Which between between the the proprietary ships and the vulnerability management, which would you pick as the number one out of those two. Probably vulnerability management. Okay. I'm just kind of scanning the list. I would probably say like Cooper netties agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in Although I think the communities agent and from an integration point of view. Perhaps the terraform integration. I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already. So I'm gonna I'm just going to call those get ops. And I'm going to put like kid s agent. Plus She for integrations. It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Well, let's You know, let's try to. This is due Tuesday, I think we want"
