1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
[Speaker_00]  I can record and we don't have a ton of items to get to and I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:29,460
[Speaker_00]  So corporate events, they, I think I saw a little, I put this in Slack and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,820
[Speaker_00]  you know the the nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and tried different things

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:47,500
[Speaker_00]  the event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be so the current tactic

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:55,799
[Speaker_00]  that we're going with is go to market team signs up and kind of sponsors that event so

6
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:03,520
[Speaker_00]  you support as a PMM your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event etc etc etc uh I don't

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,359
[Speaker_00]  see anyone in the uh maybe there are comments in the issue I don't see the the header updated yet

8
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,920
[Speaker_00]  I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them out that's so I guess the the next

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,420
[Speaker_00]  So it looks like Ty put in some folks.

10
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,159
[Speaker_00]  It looks like this looks good.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,500
[Speaker_00]  So the, let's see, need support from GTM teams.

12
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:43,519
[Speaker_00]  So I guess the ask would be to work with your GTM teams.

13
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,920
[Speaker_00]  So let me ask, I saw some Slack, I think in our Slack,

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,900
[Speaker_00]  but did you all uh were you all able to connect with like your gtm teams

15
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:03,900
[Speaker_00]  uh on slack only and on the issue actually yeah same not in not in real time but you know source

16
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,280
[Speaker_00]  feedback i got one person to respond so far so it may end up cindy being you and i just picking

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,020
[Speaker_00]  the one that we want to do and then they can back us up um if we don't get any more feedback

18
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:26,520
[Speaker_00]  Yeah, do you all, does anybody have like a regular sync still? Are those all been canceled or is there?

19
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,479
[Speaker_01]  Yeah, we're on like a two week cadence.

20
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:34,199
[Speaker_01]  Okay.

21
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,699
[Speaker_01]  Yeah, GitOps has been canceled after the enablement.

22
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:47,080
[Speaker_01]  cool so i'm just trying to catch up with the thread um

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,000
[Speaker_01]  so it looks like maybe a platform on reinvent

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,199
[Speaker_01]  cicd on google next and get ops on kubecon does that sound right yeah yep that's where we were

25
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:12,500
[Speaker_01]  last I heard cool so then I think um I think we can we can help the corp events team they do they

26
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,960
[Speaker_01]  do a lot of like uh cat herding and you know keep on tracking people down so I think if if this team

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:28,419
[Speaker_01]  can take the mission to like try to help track that down so if you you know get the commitment

28
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:34,340
[Speaker_01]  specifically from your campaign managers hey like we're signing up for kubecon you know can you

29
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:42,439
[Speaker_01]  comment on the issue that yes i can commit to this etc etc etc you know um so that just so that they

30
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:49,180
[Speaker_01]  can get that that event support but that looks good and i appreciate uh thanks for the link to

31
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:59,319
[Speaker_01]  on the rolls uh product announcements so i appreciate brian for adding this i uh i probably

32
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:07,840
[Speaker_01]  should have added it but i had two questions about that one one is over what time frame are we looking

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:17,620
[Speaker_01]  at so uh so in theory this is this could be the same as the git lab 14 launch where we're saying

34
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,399
[Speaker_01]  basically since 13.0, what kind of big improvements have we made?

35
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,980
[Speaker_02]  Candidly, this is always a little bit tough, and I'm not totally sure of all of the

36
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,860
[Speaker_02]  interplay here, but I think this is the general gist of this assignment.

37
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,300
[Speaker_02]  is, okay, we have commit coming up.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
[Speaker_02]  We have some amount of, like, we have a stage,

39
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,519
[Speaker_02]  you know, a metaphorical stage

40
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,560
[Speaker_02]  to say something to the world

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,139
[Speaker_02]  and we'll get some amount of press attention

42
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,240
[Speaker_02]  because we're having an event, right?

43
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,399
[Speaker_02]  What kind of announcements do we make?

44
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:14,517
[Speaker_02]  At GitLab it really really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely public yada yada yada So the thought here is to but also because our entire roadmap is

45
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:19,537
[Speaker_02]  completely public and because we ship these tiny little MVCs, a new feature will come out,

46
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:25,817
[Speaker_02]  but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year

47
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:31,877
[Speaker_02]  and say, okay, like what started in the last year, but now is really like a full-fledged feature

48
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,777
[Speaker_02]  what would be coming out of beta, right?

49
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,537
[Speaker_02]  Like if we were any other company

50
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,217
[Speaker_02]  when we started a beta program in this last year,

51
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:42,917
[Speaker_02]  what would we be announcing as GA at commit?

52
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,677
[Speaker_02]  That's kind of my thought on it.

53
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:47,877
[Speaker_02]  I see a couple of head nods.

54
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:48,397
[Speaker_02]  What do you think, Cindy?

55
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:54,097
[Speaker_00]  Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things

56
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:56,917
[Speaker_00]  to say like vulnerability management

57
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,717
[Speaker_00]  because there were tiny little MVCs all the way along.

58
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,817
[Speaker_00]  But if you look at over the course of the year,

59
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:08,637
[Speaker_00]  we went from this to this it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual

60
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:18,157
[Speaker_00]  little thing and then the other point was we just had 14.0 can we just can we reuse some of those

61
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:24,357
[Speaker_00]  things and plug them in here absolutely yeah yeah and vulnerability management was was one of the

62
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:30,157
[Speaker_00]  you know the features out of we we looked at 14.0 so i think yeah this is like let's take the stuff

63
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:36,657
[Speaker_00]  from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or

64
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:42,157
[Speaker_00]  give give our PR team this is kind of like input into our PR team to give them fodder to go out

65
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:49,577
[Speaker_00]  with and are we trying to hit three per stage I yeah ideally there's just you know three you know

66
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:55,857
[Speaker_00]  uh three items per stage and then I think y'all made some good notes that okay we need to add

67
00:06:55,857 --> 00:07:02,577
[Speaker_00]  manage so i see manage in here that's excellent um and uh integrations we don't

68
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:08,037
[Speaker_00]  well actually we have some pretty exciting integrations so we have the jira stuff is

69
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:13,957
[Speaker_00]  pretty good there's a couple of things in uh integrations with vs code that could be notable but

70
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:21,577
[Speaker_00]  i can i show what i did for scm just to get some general feedback on it and

71
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:24,857
[Speaker_00]  If someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick them.

72
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:30,597
[Speaker_00]  I was going Cindy's direction here, which was thinking, you know, a lot of,

73
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,817
[Speaker_00]  and then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things.

74
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:38,837
[Speaker_00]  So I listed a few specific things, like three or four per each as key iterations,

75
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,037
[Speaker_00]  but I called them something overall.

76
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,917
[Speaker_00]  So we would have like one thing to call them.

77
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:48,357
[Speaker_01]  There are several key iterations aligned with Gittaway cluster,

78
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:54,857
[Speaker_01]  several that roll up to a research-based user experience and I was thinking like

79
00:07:54,857 --> 00:08:02,237
[Speaker_01]  I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket except that actually that's that's super typical right

80
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:06,717
[Speaker_01]  like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out they almost always have UX as one of their

81
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:13,617
[Speaker_01]  three things and then they mention a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that so I you know forgave

82
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:18,797
[Speaker_01]  myself for doing something at first I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some

83
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:23,597
[Speaker_01]  things there but actually when I looked around that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch

84
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:28,617
[Speaker_01]  and in terms of the excitement level that also like I went in thinking this is just a two

85
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:33,557
[Speaker_01]  I guess part of it is like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken and that's

86
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:38,037
[Speaker_01]  not something you want to shout from the rooftops about but actually some of that stuff's really

87
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:42,657
[Speaker_01]  cool so I gave it a three excitement level I wasn't sure exactly where to place things

88
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:48,897
[Speaker_01]  but I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment have something that's a one here anyway

89
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:55,577
[Speaker_01]  but I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to to bucket them as something

90
00:08:55,577 --> 00:09:00,498
[Speaker_01]  and so that's kind of how I came down on it and what everyone thinks about that

91
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:05,798
[Speaker_01]  I like that.

92
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:07,377
[Speaker_01]  Go ahead.

93
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:08,097
[Speaker_01]  No, no, no.

94
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:14,298
[Speaker_02]  I've done a similar, I've taken a similar approach for monitor.

95
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,777
[Speaker_02]  With incident management, there were a bunch of things that we released.

96
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:24,657
[Speaker_02]  Although the core of incident management was part of 12.x, I think.

97
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:28,377
[Speaker_02]  So I did the same over there as well.

98
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:28,798
[Speaker_02]  Yeah.

99
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,557
[Speaker_02]  I think that makes sense.

100
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:35,457
[Speaker_02]  Yeah, and that would help me with the planned stuff as well, because there are some things

101
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:40,577
[Speaker_02]  like Epic boards that people have been asking for for years now, and they finally have,

102
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:41,238
[Speaker_02]  and that's great.

103
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:48,037
[Speaker_02]  But I think, you know, like the milestone burn-up charts, that was a two, and that's

104
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:48,697
[Speaker_02]  helpful.

105
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:54,057
[Speaker_02]  And I was looking through features and, you know, actual monthly features that were released

106
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:54,857
[Speaker_02]  in a given month.

107
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,798
[Speaker_02]  I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting.

108
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:02,017
[Speaker_02]  but we can bundle that with some other things and, and, and up level it.

109
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:04,017
[Speaker_02]  So that, that would be helpful there.

110
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:05,837
[Speaker_02]  And also Brian about the VS code thing.

111
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:21,855
[Speaker_02]  One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were community contributions which is also kind of cool Is that do we have VS code listed on here

112
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:27,835
[Speaker_00]  I didn't add it, but I can add that in. I've got good notes on that.

113
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:32,875
[Speaker_00]  The extension that had been around for a while became official, was kind of one of the things,

114
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,135
[Speaker_00]  but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that.

115
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:46,255
[Speaker_00]  and that i think that's a that's a pretty good note as well um we did that with like our our

116
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:52,715
[Speaker_00]  terraform module right there was like a community module but now it's officially supported so that's

117
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:57,555
[Speaker_00]  that's the you know that can be the line yes or no whether you can use the thing

118
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:04,875
[Speaker_00]  for a lot of businesses so i think that's a good one too how are we measuring excitement levels

119
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,795
[Speaker_00]  one, two, and three is there?

120
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,095
[Speaker_01]  I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric

121
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,555
[Speaker_01]  to perhaps measure whether customers

122
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,075
[Speaker_01]  have started using that,

123
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,755
[Speaker_01]  are interested in using that or not.

124
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,555
[Speaker_01]  We probably may not have it for everything,

125
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,115
[Speaker_01]  but at least some of it,

126
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:26,135
[Speaker_01]  wherever we have it,

127
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,075
[Speaker_01]  it's probably something we can use.

128
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,815
[Speaker_01]  But of course, we need a benchmark level

129
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:36,235
[Speaker_01]  of what MAU we want to call one, two, or three?

130
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,735
[Speaker_01]  I think it's a little bit of a judgment call.

131
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:44,555
[Speaker_01]  Like, you know, for example,

132
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,555
[Speaker_01]  Cormac was saying like Epic boards

133
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,755
[Speaker_01]  is something that was asked for for a long time.

134
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,495
[Speaker_01]  Now, depending on how it's asked for,

135
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,635
[Speaker_01]  maybe that means it's exciting or it's not, right?

136
00:11:57,195 --> 00:12:00,635
[Speaker_02]  But usually when something gets a lot of upvotes

137
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,935
[Speaker_02]  or when there's a lot of demand for it,

138
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,755
[Speaker_02]  then I would bump the excitement level

139
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:05,715
[Speaker_02]  on something like that.

140
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,275
[Speaker_00]  Certainly, if something's shipped

141
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,675
[Speaker_00]  and a lot of people are using it,

142
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,575
[Speaker_00]  the MAU, that's another good measure.

143
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,995
[Speaker_00]  I don't know that any one of those

144
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:16,935
[Speaker_00]  needs to kind of be exclusive.

145
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,455
[Speaker_00]  I think it's a bit of an individual judgment call

146
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,515
[Speaker_00]  on just like what is your feeling based on,

147
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,315
[Speaker_00]  you know, could be anecdotal,

148
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,255
[Speaker_00]  like you talk to customers

149
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,415
[Speaker_00]  and they're like really hyper excited about this.

150
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:37,895
[Speaker_01]  or, you know, maybe not, which is, which is okay. I think it's okay.

151
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:46,095
[Speaker_02]  Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something

152
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:56,255
[Speaker_02]  about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah, I might, I might even constrain us as we're not

153
00:12:56,255 --> 00:13:01,135
[Speaker_02]  going to highlight loc segments, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we

154
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:06,675
[Speaker_02]  have slim pickings. Alternately, if there are double digit entries, then we can stack rank.

155
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:17,155
[Speaker_00]  So that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these, that, I mean,

156
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:21,075
[Speaker_00]  it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features.

157
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:31,335
[Speaker_00]  so um i might constrain it like this maybe you can only give out one one two or three

158
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:38,055
[Speaker_00]  and and treat it as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't

159
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:45,455
[Speaker_00]  necessarily hard somebody's one or somebody's three may be more important than somebody else's

160
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:52,955
[Speaker_00]  one. I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year

161
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:59,035
[Speaker_00]  from Create. And there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning

162
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:03,755
[Speaker_00]  that could be on the list. I could give you 10 things instead of three.

163
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:14,135
[Speaker_00]  Give this just the rough pass. And like a lot of things recently, I've been moving between docs

164
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,975
[Speaker_00]  and spreadsheet and the spreadsheet to docs,

165
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:20,195
[Speaker_00]  this might end up or some iteration of this

166
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,175
[Speaker_00]  might end up in a spreadsheet

167
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,575
[Speaker_00]  where we then try to stack rank and PR is like,

168
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,115
[Speaker_00]  okay, out of all of the,

169
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,975
[Speaker_00]  there's maybe 10 boxes here and three,

170
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:31,255
[Speaker_00]  each out of the 30 items, which are the top five.

171
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:35,915
[Speaker_01]  Actually, let's actually just do that.

172
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:39,855
[Speaker_01]  Let's just do this like top five overall.

173
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,955
[Speaker_01]  This one is a PR driven to some degree.

174
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:47,855
[Speaker_01]  What about like a Noop and Christie's product keynote at commit?

175
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,895
[Speaker_01]  Are we dovetailing this with that?

176
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,435
[Speaker_01]  So this is exactly where this is headed to,

177
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:58,195
[Speaker_01]  is the idea that during the product keynote,

178
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:01,215
[Speaker_01]  and then ideally during Sid's keynote as well,

179
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,995
[Speaker_01]  that there's some level of like an announcement that we make

180
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,935
[Speaker_01]  that then the press cares about that announcement.

181
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,355
[Speaker_01]  Again, really tough to do at GitLab

182
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:13,035
[Speaker_01]  because it's all been around for a while.

183
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:27,853
[Speaker_01]  So this is our attempt to head to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event And yeah maybe it some things that have been around for a while but like now they at a level of maturity now you know there there

184
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:37,153
[Speaker_01]  reason to be excited about this so that's kind of where it's coming from so i put uh a top five

185
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:43,753
[Speaker_01]  overall, maybe we can just, you know.

186
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:53,973
[Speaker_02]  We should reserve a spot for plan, but I'm going to have to go through and do some aggregating

187
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:58,853
[Speaker_02]  after this. Just go through the list of what's shipped in the last 12 months and re-bucket that.

188
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:02,853
[Speaker_02]  so uh

189
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:14,333
[Speaker_02]  maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like um just just time box and uh kind of look at these

190
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:21,093
[Speaker_02]  here what do what do you all think is a top would be a top five out of the list of you know

191
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,873
[Speaker_02]  20 or 30.

192
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,933
[Speaker_00]  I would say if UX does end up being a flag that we fly,

193
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:35,093
[Speaker_00]  that's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage

194
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,313
[Speaker_00]  that would be considered UX improvement.

195
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,193
[Speaker_00]  Okay.

196
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:47,333
[Speaker_01]  What else?

197
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,893
[Speaker_01]  We need to have a security one in there.

198
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:54,893
[Speaker_01]  We could have either vulnerability management or I was,

199
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,873
[Speaker_01]  what I've been struggling with a little bit is I'd like to kind of group the,

200
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:04,033
[Speaker_01]  some of this, the proprietary scanning

201
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:11,153
[Speaker_01]  without making it sound like they're scanning improvements,

202
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:14,054
[Speaker_01]  because that sounds like they weren't good before.

203
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:15,233
[Speaker_01]  Yeah.

204
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:22,473
[Speaker_01]  I let's let's go with vulnerability management for now I I would agree on that one and I would

205
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:29,173
[Speaker_01]  say that um some of these we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one

206
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:36,693
[Speaker_01]  thing so we might not get that's kind of old I I was I mean we did the fuzzing acquisitions

207
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,353
[Speaker_01]  a long time ago.

208
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:42,533
[Speaker_01]  Was it within the past year or longer?

209
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,193
[Speaker_02]  I thought it was within the past year.

210
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:50,233
[Speaker_02]  I think it was in the last little over six months or so.

211
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,953
[Speaker_02]  It was last summer, right?

212
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:54,893
[Speaker_02]  It was like last spring or summer.

213
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:59,054
[Speaker_02]  And then we did another set of press around the integration of it

214
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:02,073
[Speaker_02]  because the PR team liked all the, I mean,

215
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,033
[Speaker_02]  we got a lot of attention on the acquisition.

216
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:09,054
[Speaker_02]  So they had me do a follow-up on the integration.

217
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:12,113
[Speaker_02]  I just feel like it's kind of worn out now.

218
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:13,314
[Speaker_02]  Right.

219
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:16,733
[Speaker_02]  That's what I was saying is that the fuzzing we already did press on

220
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,173
[Speaker_02]  probably will not get another chomp at that.

221
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,233
[Speaker_02]  So I think let's go with vulnerability management.

222
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:23,113
[Speaker_02]  Unreviewed.

223
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,433
[Speaker_02]  Well, we also have, in terms of proprietary stuff,

224
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:31,433
[Speaker_02]  we've also got, we replaced one of our scanners with SEMGRIP.

225
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:55,853
[Speaker_02]  And we did, we have our own proprietary DAST scanner now that's in, it's in beta called Browserker. So it's our answer to scanning single page applications, which represent a unique challenge. I think, I mean, if I could have to, it would be vulnerability management and Browserker probably.

226
00:18:55,853 --> 00:19:02,493
[Speaker_02]  okay semgrep that get picked up as a online item and a couple of the pieces about get back 14

227
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:13,433
[Speaker_02]  which uh between between the the proprietary ships of the vulnerability management which

228
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:19,613
[Speaker_02]  would you pick as the number one out of those two probably vulnerability management okay

229
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:23,633
[Speaker_02]  I'm just kind of scanning the list.

230
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:29,993
[Speaker_02]  I would probably say like Kubernetes agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in.

231
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:31,533
[Speaker_02]  Although.

232
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:41,433
[Speaker_00]  I think the Kubernetes agent and from an integration point of view.

233
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:45,353
[Speaker_01]  Perhaps the Terraform integration.

234
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:50,473
[Speaker_01]  I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already.

235
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:55,554
[Speaker_01]  I'm just going to call those GitOps.

236
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:05,733
[Speaker_01]  And I'm going to put like KDS agent plus Heshi corp integrations.

237
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:10,733
[Speaker_01]  It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about.

238
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:10,794
[Speaker_01]  Ah.

239
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:13,833
[Speaker_02]  I forgot.

240
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:22,353
[Speaker_00]  Cool.

241
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:27,773
[Speaker_00]  Well, let's try to, this is due Tuesday, I think.
